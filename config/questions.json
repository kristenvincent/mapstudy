Specifically, this project investigates the application of these maps for spatial decision-making, and uses a case study about the North American hazardous waste trade. </br></br> <strong><u>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</u></strong></br>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete an online survey using interactive maps. The survey should take approximately 30 minutes.</br></br> <strong><u>ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO ME?</u></strong></br>Risks of participation are minimal. You will be asked to provide background information, but no personally identifying information will be requested.</br></br><strong><u>ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO ME?</u></strong></br>There are no direct benefits for participating.</br></br> <strong><u>WILL I BE COMPENSATED FOR MY TIME?</u></strong></br>You will receive $5 upon completion of the map survey.</br></br><strong><u>HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?</u></strong></br>If you agree to participate, no individual or confidential information will be used in publications of this work. All responses will be stored on a secure computer. </br></br><strong><u>WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</u></strong></br>You may ask questions about the research at any time. Please contact Robert Roth (reroth@wisc.edu) or Kristen Vincent (kvincent2@wisc.edu) with any questions. </br></br> If you are not satisfied with the response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the University of Wisconsin-Madison Education Research and Social & Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320. </br><br> Your participation is completely voluntary.

							"ask": "<strong>Thank you for agreeing to participate!</strong></br></br>Digital interactive maps are now a part of our everyday lives. This research investigates how such interactive maps can or cannot help us make choices about the management and regulation of commodities in the landscape.</br></br> Specifically, the following survey uses the North American regulation and trade of hazardous waste as a case study. Tons of hazardous waste are traded among Canada, Mexico, and the United States daily, creating many management decisions that ensure safe disposal. Such choices about how to regulate hazardous waste are complex, requiring consideration of a number of potential solutions. In this study, you will be asked to make two different decisions about the hazardous waste trade using information provided in an interactive map.</br></br><strong><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></strong></br></br>The survey proceeds in four sections: <ol><li>First, you will be given an example map to familiarize yourself with the map symbols and map controls used in the study. You also will be given an example task to get a feel for the kinds of decisions you will need to make with the interactive maps. Use as much time as you wish to study the example map and learn how to use its controls, as these responses are not recorded.</li><li>You then will be presented with two different scenarios related to the regulation and trade of hazardous waste trade. Each scenario focuses on a different region in the United States and includes a different interactive map to support your decision. For each scenario, make use of the interactive map to arrive at a decision you feel is <strong>optimal</strong>. After each decision, you will be asked to assess your <strong>confidence</strong> in the decision solution and to rate your <strong>difficulty</strong> in making this choice. Please complete these questions using your complete focus (do not view other websites, split your attention, etc.).</li><li>Between the two scenarios, you will complete a set of map reading tasks with a static map showing the distribution of hazardous waste imports in the United States. Please complete these questions using your complete focus, as they are meant to refresh your train of thought from the prior decision.</li><li>After completing all map tasks, you will respond to a series of background questions about your interests and experiences. You will be compensated after you submit the background survey.</li></ol>Throughout the survey, <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the web browser “Back” or “Forward” buttons or close your browser, as this will require you to restart the survey. Only use the “Next” buttons found at the bottom of the pages to advance the survey.</br></br><strong><u>ELIGIBILITY:</u></strong></br></br>Before beginning, please once again review your eligibility for participating in the study. These restrictions greatly impact your responses:</br><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age or older.</li><li>English must be your first language.</li><li>You must currently be living in the United States, but not in the states of Ohio or Texas, the location of the pair of scenarios. </li><li>You must complete the survey on a laptop or desktop computer (i.e., <strong>NOT</strong> a mobile device such as a phone or tablet). </li></ul></br></br><strong>Select 'Next' to confirm that you have read the instructions and confirm that you are eligible and ready to view the example map.</strong>"

This project is investigating interface complexity of interactive maps for spatial decision-making about the North American hazardous waste trade. </br></br> <strong><u>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</u></strong></br>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete a map-based survey about the North American hazardous waste trade. The survey should take 30-60 minutes.</br></br> <strong><u>ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO ME?</u></strong></br>Risks of participation are minimal. You will be asked to provide background information, but no personally identifying information will be requested.</br></br><strong><u>ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO ME?</u></strong></br>There are no direct benefits for participating.</br></br> <strong><u>WILL I BE COMPENSATED FOR MY TIME?</u></strong></br>You will receive $5 upon completion of the map survey.</br></br><strong><u>HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?</u></strong></br>If you agree to participate, any personally identifying information will not be used in any publications of this work. All responses will be stored on a secure computer. </br></br><strong><u>WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</u></strong></br>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. Please contact Kristen Vincent at kvincent2@wisc.edu with any questions. </br></br> If you are not satisfied with the response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the University of Wisconsin-Madison Education Research and Social & Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320. </br><br> Your participation is completely voluntary.

This research seeks to explore the impact the interface has on users performing a decision-making task. Specifically, we are interested in the effects of changing the complexity of the map interface. Further, spatial decisions are complex problems and interactive maps can help users make informed decisions. Hazardous waste flows among Canada, Mexico, and the United States daily, with many management decisions needed to ensure safe transport and disposal. In this study, you will be asked to perform a decision task about the hazardous waste trade using an interactive map.</br></br><strong><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></strong></br></br>In the map survey, you will be asked to complete two ranking tasks with a series of benchmark questions in between. After each map, you will be asked your confidence in your answer and how difficult you felt the task was. </br></br>Before your task begins, you will be given an example map to work with. After your decision tasks are completed, you will be asked a series of background questions. You will be compensated after you complete the the map task and submit your survey.</br></br><strong><u>ELIGIBILITY:</u></strong></br></br>Before beginning, please once again review your eligibility for participating in the study. These restrictions greatly impact your responses:</br><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age or older.</li><li>English must be your first language.</li><li>You must currently be living in the United States.</li><li>You must complete the survey on a laptop or desktop computer (i.e. not mobile). </li></ul></br></br><strong>Select 'Next' to confirm that you have read the instructions and confirm that you are eligible and ready to go to an example.</strong>"

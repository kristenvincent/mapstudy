This project is investigating interface complexity of interactive maps for spatial decision-making, and will use a case study example about the North American hazardous waste trade. </br></br> <strong><u>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</u></strong></br>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete an online survey. The survey should take approximately 30 minutes.</br></br> <strong><u>ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO ME?</u></strong></br>Risks of participation are minimal. You will be asked to provide background information, but no personally identifying information will be requested.</br></br><strong><u>ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO ME?</u></strong></br>There are no direct benefits for participating.</br></br> <strong><u>WILL I BE COMPENSATED FOR MY TIME?</u></strong></br>You will receive $5 upon completion of the map survey.</br></br><strong><u>HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?</u></strong></br>If you agree to participate, any personally identifying information will not be used in any publications of this work. All responses will be stored on a secure computer. </br></br><strong><u>WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</u></strong></br>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. Please contact Kristen Vincent (kvincent2@wisc.edu) with any questions. </br></br> If you are not satisfied with the response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the University of Wisconsin-Madison Education Research and Social & Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320. </br><br> Your participation is completely voluntary. If you decide not to participate or to withdraw from the study, it will have no effect on you.</br></br><strong>By selecting 'Next' below, you indicate that you have read through this consent form, had the opportunity to ask questions about your participation, and you agree to participate. <br><br> If you agree to participate in this research study, select the 'Next' button below, otherwise, close your browser to exit:</strong>"

							"ask": "<strong>Thank you for agreeing to participate!</strong></br></br>Digital interactive maps are now a part of our everyday lives. This research investigates how such interactive maps can or cannot help us make choices about the management of goods and materials in the landscape.</br></br> Specifically, the following survey uses the regulation and trade of hazardous waste as a case study. Hazardous waste flows among Canada, Mexico, and the United States daily, with many management decisions needed to ensure safe transport and disposal. Thus, our choices about how to regulate hazardous waste require consideration of a number of spatial criteria and have a number of potential solutions. In this study, you will be asked to make two different decisions about the hazardous waste trade using two different interactive maps.</br></br><strong><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></strong></br></br>In the map survey, you will be presented with two scenarios common to the regulation and trade of hazardous waste. For each scenario, you will make use of an interactive map to arrive at a decision you feel is optimal. After each decision, you will be asked to assess your confidence in the solution at which you arrived and to rate the difficulty you had in making this choice. Between the pair of scenarios, you will complete a set of map reading tasks with a static map to refresh your train of thought. </br></br>Before your task begins, you will be given an example map to work with. After your decision tasks are completed, you will be asked a series of background questions. The entire survey should take about 30 minutes. You will be compensated after you complete all map tasks and a background survey and submit the responses at the end.</br></br><strong><u>ELIGIBILITY:</u></strong></br></br>Before beginning, please once again review your eligibility for participating in the study. These restrictions greatly impact your responses:</br><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age or older.</li><li>English must be your first language.</li><li>You must currently be living in the United States, but not in the states of Ohio or Texas, the location of the pair of scenarios. </li><li>You must complete the survey on a laptop or desktop computer (i.e. not mobile). </li></ul></br></br><strong>Select 'Next' to confirm that you have read the instructions and confirm that you are eligible and ready to go to an example.</strong>"

Your job is to examine previous reports to understand each company’s past compliance record, as well as examine public concerns about the facilities in their respective communities.
